The white dot that circulates the outside of the clock will tell you what time it is.  When the dot is at the top of the circle, it is night. When it is at the bottom, it is daytime. You can tell what time of day it is by the pictures on the clock. Red denotes sunset and purple denotes sunrise.",

Your Digimon will be one of three types: virus, data or vaccine. Types in Digimon World are not like Pok√©mon: one type doesn't dominate another.  What they will do, though, is prevent some battles. Sometimes, a Digimon of the same type will not want to battle with you, and leaves the scene without a fight. As for techniques, always make sure that your Digimon has three techniques to choose from, for an easier time in battles.",
